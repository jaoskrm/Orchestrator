A 2.0 kg box is launched with an initial speed of 8.0 m/s up a 30° incline. 
The coefficient of kinetic friction between the box and incline is μk = 0.20.

1) How far up the incline does the box travel before stopping?
2) What is the box's speed when it returns to the starting point?

Use g = 9.8 m/s². Give numerical answers with units.
